## Emissivity characterization of materials

My main topic up to now has concerned the measurement and characterization of emissive properties of materials. This includes mostly, but not exclusively, new materials for energy applications, from [solar thermal energy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2019.109961) to [nuclear fusion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnucmat.2018.10.051). Accurate emissivity characterizations are necessary for proper estimations of heat-transfer capabilities and efficiencies of these materials. To that end, one of my main tasks during my PhD has been to [upgrade the HAIRL emissometer](https://doi.org/10.1088/1681-7575/ab84ff) of the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU.

## Infrared spectroscopy and optical properties of solids

In addition to the applied side of emissivity measurements, I find the more fundamental spectroscopic side of it fascinating. At the moment, I have [limited published experience](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2017.02.016) on this topic, which is why I would like to specialize in this topic during my postdoctoral stage. At the moment, I have unpublished work on the phonon dynamics of rutile and the anomalous skin effect of noble metals. I have also been involved in other spectroscopic problems tackled using emissivity measurements, such as the study of [corrosion processes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.corsci.2020.108723).

## Physics education

As side projects to my main research-related topics, I am also very interested in educational projects concerning [new teaching methodologies](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1287/1/012027). Moreover, I am an active reviewer for the European Journal of Physics and plan on releasing a couple of articles on the topic of Planck's law and the way it is taught.
