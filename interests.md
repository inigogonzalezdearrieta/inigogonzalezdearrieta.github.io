## Radiative heat transfer

My main topic up to now has concerned the measurement and characterization of emissive properties of materials. This includes mostly, but not exclusively, new materials for energy applications, from [solar thermal energy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solmat.2019.109961) to [nuclear fusion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnucmat.2018.10.051). Accurate emissivity characterizations are necessary for proper estimations of heat-transfer capabilities and efficiencies of these materials. To that end, one of my main tasks during my PhD was to [upgrade the HAIRL emissometer](https://doi.org/10.1088/1681-7575/ab84ff) of the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU.

## Optical properties of solids

In addition to the applied side of emissivity measurements, I find the more fundamental spectroscopic side of it fascinating. This is the topic I'm specializing on at my current postdoctoral position. At the moment, I have already published two papers on the [optical conductivity of rutile at high temperatures](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0056081) and a novel approach to study the lattice dynamics of oxide nanoparticles ([cerium oxide](https://doi.org/10.1039/D1CP01259B) and [aluminum oxide](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.saa.2023.122795)). I have also unpublished data concerning the anomalous skin effect of noble metals. Finally, I have also been involved in less conventional spectroscopic problems tackled using emissivity measurements, such as the study of [corrosion processes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.corsci.2020.108723).

## Physics education and history of science

As side projects to my main research-related topics, I am also very interested in educational projects concerning [new teaching methodologies](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1287/1/012027) and misunderstandings regarding [Planck's and Wien's laws and the way they're taught](https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0006130). Moreover, I am an active reviewer for the European Journal of Physics and plan on releasing more educational and historical articles in the future. Finally, I have also written a [short biography of Heinrich Rubens](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjh/s13129-022-00044-x), a pioneer of infrared technology.
