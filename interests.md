## Emissivity characterization of materials

My main topic up to now has concerned the measurement and characterization of emissive properties of materials. This includes mostly, but not exclusively, new materials for energy applications. Accurate emissivity characterizations are necessary for 

## Infrared spectroscopy and optical properties of solids

In pBN, as well as some future work on rutile and the anomalous skin effect. Even if they are based in emissivity measurements, they go beyond the standard characterization.

This is also the field I would like to specialize into during my postdoc.

## Measurement

One of my main tasks during my PhD has been to upgrade the HAIRL emissometer of the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU.

## Corrosion processes

Even if they are based in emissivity measurements, they go beyond the standard characterization.

## Physics education

As side projects to my main research-related topics, I am also very interested in 
Combining strategies to make General Physics lectures more attractive and to improve studentsâ€™ performances
Wien's displacement law and blackbody radiation quartiles
On the physical basis of colour vision
